You are tasked with building a movie discovery app built in react. This app will
display movies in a grid and give the user more information when they click on
one of the posters. To fetch the movie info, we will be using [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/)
and will include the API key for you to add to the `.env` in the initial email.

### Features
